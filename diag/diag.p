aS"1800026259\tThe Winners (1999)\tWhat becomes of the world-class violinists and pianists who win Brussels' Queen Elizabeth Competition - the musicians' Olympics? Four winners spanning the period 1955-1976 tell their stories. Most intriguing is Philipp Hirschhorn, once touted as the new Paganini. Now a broken man, he is seen watching scenes of himself some 20 years earlier, resplendent in white tie and tails, playing the violin brilliantly. His eyes come alive, but only for a moment. The film suggests that the reality of musical celebrity is darker and infinitely more complex than one might imagine. Questions of personality, musical technique, political intrigue, anti-Semitism (concerning the Russian Jews), bad timing, and bad luck are brought to bear in this fascinating exploration of what it takes to go from being a winner to becoming a star.\t1 hr. 25 min.\tNR\t\\N\tJanuary 20, 1999\t19990120\tFirst Run Features\tguide/01896901.jpg\tArt/Foreign|Documentary\tPaul Cohen\t1800026260\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\n"

One of their first stops is a bar where the women relax, dance, and flirt with some of the locals. But the situation turns ugly when one man (Timothy Carhart) follows Thelma to the parking lot and attempts to rape her, causing Louise to shoot and accidentally kill him. Convinced that the police will never believe their version of the incident, the women take off, now fugitives from the law. Emboldened by recent events, Thelma picks up studly young cowboy J.D. (Brad Pitt) in Oklahoma and enjoys a one-night stand that leads to even more trouble. Director Ridley Scott's infamous feminist road movie ranks among the best films of the 1990s. Along with BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN, the film is one of Scott's finest works, largely because of Callie Khourie's vivid, brilliantly idiosyncratic script, wonderful performances from the two leads, and Adrian's Biddle's crisp photography of the American Southwest.\t\\N\tR\t\\N\t\t19910101\t\\N\tallposters/22/1800026322p-th.jpg\t\\N\tRidley Scott\t1800015105\tEditor|Screenwriter|Cinematographer\tThom Noble|Callie Khouri|Adrian Biddle\t1800193636|1800242845|1800108027\tSusan Sarandon|Geena Davis|Harvey Keitel|Christopher McDonald|Brad Pitt|Michael Madsen|Timothy Carhart|Susen Sarandon\t1800019379|1800012507|1800014968|1800021801|1800018965|1800021340|1800056643|1800026323\t\\N\t\\N\t2\t15\tBest Original Screenplay (Academy 1991)|Best Screenplay (Golden Globe 1992)\tBest Actress (Academy 1991)|Best Director (Academy 1991)|Best Cinematography (Academy 1991)|Best Editing (Academy 1991)|Best Film (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Director (David Lean Award) (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Actress (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Original Screenplay (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Film (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|Best Actress (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|10 Best Films (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Actress (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Film (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Actress (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Supporting Actor (SOC 1991)\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t9.91345920653497\t10.3170731707317\t41\n"

Demetrius himself bicycles into the woods to follow his true love Hermia. Demetrius is soon followed by yet another desperate lover: Helena, who adores Demetrius but finds her affections dreadfully unrequited.

Chaos ensues when the trickster Puck (Stanley Tucci) administers a secret love potion-causing the lovers to mix-and-match with outrageous results.

S'1800034007 Being There (1979) BEING THERE is based on Jerzy Kosinski\x92s short comic novel about a simpleton, Chance (Peter Sellers), raised in isolation whose only education came from watching TV. When he\x92s forced out of the house where he worked as a gardener by the death of the wealthy recluse who raised him from infancy, he\x92s fortuitously struck by a limousine carrying Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), the wife of a wealthy industrialist. He\x92s mistaken, because of his well-tailored suits, for a man of means and taken to dinner with her husband, Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas). There, as Chauncy Gardner, his blank affect is taken for seriousness and his literal pronouncements about gardening for metaphoric economic predictions. Soon he\x92s meeting the president (Jack Warden) and becoming a star on TV--where he\x92s a natural.Kosinski was well known to be personally fascinated by the power of television. In BEING THERE, which he adapted for the screen himself, he presents a comic fable about a man whose entire sense of reality came from watching television. Sellers is marvelous as the always-deadpan cipher in whom everyone he meets sees whatever it is they need to see. Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden, and Melvyn Douglas give outstanding performances in this biting satire directed by Hal Ashby. \\N PG \\N  \\N \\N /video/images/muze/dvd/sm/39/173139.jpg'

S'1800023931 Pecker (1998) The winning 10th feature from John Waters straddles a fine line between the eager vulgarity of his earlier works and the sloppy sweetness of HAIRSPRAY and CRY-BABY. Set, as usual, in Baltimore, the film stars Edward Furlong as Pecker, a sweet-natured young fellow who happily passes the days photographing his surroundings with a cheap secondhand camera. Egging him on are his Virgin Mary-obsessed grandmother (Jean Schertler), his sugar-addicted younger sister (Lauren Hulsey), his kleptomaniac best friend (Brendan Sexton III), and his girlfriend (Christina Ricci), who runs a Laundromat with an iron fist. When Pecker\x92s works are "discovered" by a slumming NYC art dealer (Lili Taylor), his simple life is turned upside down, and he quickly realizes that he was happier as an unknown. A valentine to--and satire of--the art world, PECKER makes strangely poignant statements about the nature of art and the value of fame. As someone with a foot in both the New York art scene and the earthiness of Baltimore, the title character obviously has more than a touch of the director in him. As with all other Waters films, those who are familiar with Baltimore culture will be even more richly rewarded. \\N R sexuality, graphic nudity, language and brief drug use September 25, 1998 19980925 Fine Line Features \\N'
