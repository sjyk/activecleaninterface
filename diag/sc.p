aS"1800026259\tThe Winners (1999)\tWhat becomes of the world-class violinists and pianists who win Brussels' Queen Elizabeth Competition - the musicians' Olympics? Four winners spanning the period 1955-1976 tell their stories. Most intriguing is Philipp Hirschhorn, once touted as the new Paganini. Now a broken man, he is seen watching scenes of himself some 20 years earlier, resplendent in white tie and tails, playing the violin brilliantly. His eyes come alive, but only for a moment. The film suggests that the reality of musical celebrity is darker and infinitely more complex than one might imagine. Questions of personality, musical technique, political intrigue, anti-Semitism (concerning the Russian Jews), bad timing, and bad luck are brought to bear in this fascinating exploration of what it takes to go from being a winner to becoming a star.\t1 hr. 25 min.\tNR\t\\N\tJanuary 20, 1999\t19990120\tFirst Run Features\tguide/01896901.jpg\tArt/Foreign|Documentary\tPaul Cohen\t1800026260\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\n"

One of their first stops is a bar where the women relax, dance, and flirt with some of the locals. But the situation turns ugly when one man (Timothy Carhart) follows Thelma to the parking lot and attempts to rape her, causing Louise to shoot and accidentally kill him. Convinced that the police will never believe their version of the incident, the women take off, now fugitives from the law. Emboldened by recent events, Thelma picks up studly young cowboy J.D. (Brad Pitt) in Oklahoma and enjoys a one-night stand that leads to even more trouble. Director Ridley Scott's infamous feminist road movie ranks among the best films of the 1990s. Along with BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN, the film is one of Scott's finest works, largely because of Callie Khourie's vivid, brilliantly idiosyncratic script, wonderful performances from the two leads, and Adrian's Biddle's crisp photography of the American Southwest.\t\\N\tR\t\\N\t\t19910101\t\\N\tallposters/22/1800026322p-th.jpg\t\\N\tRidley Scott\t1800015105\tEditor|Screenwriter|Cinematographer\tThom Noble|Callie Khouri|Adrian Biddle\t1800193636|1800242845|1800108027\tSusan Sarandon|Geena Davis|Harvey Keitel|Christopher McDonald|Brad Pitt|Michael Madsen|Timothy Carhart|Susen Sarandon\t1800019379|1800012507|1800014968|1800021801|1800018965|1800021340|1800056643|1800026323\t\\N\t\\N\t2\t15\tBest Original Screenplay (Academy 1991)|Best Screenplay (Golden Globe 1992)\tBest Actress (Academy 1991)|Best Director (Academy 1991)|Best Cinematography (Academy 1991)|Best Editing (Academy 1991)|Best Film (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Director (David Lean Award) (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Actress (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Original Screenplay (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Film (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|Best Actress (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|10 Best Films (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Actress (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Film (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Actress (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Supporting Actor (SOC 1991)\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t9.91345920653497\t10.3170731707317\t41\n"

a(S"1800026259 The Winners (1999) What becomes of the world-class violinists and pianists who win Brussels' Queen Elizabeth Competition - the musicians' Olympics? Four winners spanning the period 1955-1976 tell their stories. Most intriguing is Philipp Hirschhorn, once touted as the new Paganini. Now a broken man, he is seen watching scenes of himself some 20 years earlier, resplendent in white tie and tails, playing the violin brilliantly. His eyes come alive, but only for a moment. The film suggests that the reality of musical celebrity is darker and infinitely more complex than one might imagine. Questions of personality, musical technique, political intrigue, anti-Semitism (concerning the Russian Jews), bad timing, and bad luck are brought to bear in this fascinating exploration of what it takes to go from being a winner to becoming a star. 1 hr. 25 min.

a(S"1800026271 The Wisdom of Crocodiles (2000) To all appearances, Steven Grlscz has everything.  He masterfully seduces women, but for him this is not a game.  It is a lonely and desperate pursuit for a woman's love he literally cannot live without.  When the body of his latest conquest is found at sea, he knows the trail will eventually lead to him, and he contacts the police under the pretense of aiding their investigation and moves on to his next victim.  Anne Levels proves more of a challenge than he ever expected, although she is torn between thinking she's in love and doubting him.  Proof that her perfect love is vital to Steven's survival and her uncertainty is slowly killing him. 1 hr. 38 min.

a(S"1800026322 Thelma & Louise (1991) Fed up with her boyfriend (Michael Madsen), live-wire Arkansas waitress Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon) persuades her friend Thelma Dickinson (Geena Davis), a naive housewife burdened with a negligent, sexist husband (Christopher McDonald), to hit the road with her for a weekend of freedom. One of their first stops is a bar where the women relax, dance, and flirt with some of the locals. But the situation turns ugly when one man (Timothy Carhart) follows Thelma to the parking lot and attempts to rape her, causing Louise to shoot and accidentally kill him. Convinced that the police will never believe their version of the incident, the women take off, now fugitives from the law. Emboldened by recent events, Thelma picks up studly young cowboy J.D. (Brad Pitt) in Oklahoma and enjoys a one-night stand that leads to even more trouble. Director Ridley Scott's infamous feminist road movie ranks among the best films of the 1990s. Along with BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN, the film is one of Scott's finest works, largely because of Callie Khourie's vivid, brilliantly idiosyncratic script, wonderful performances from the two leads, and Adrian's Biddle's crisp photography of the American Southwest. \\N R \\N  19910101 \\N allposters/22/1800026322p-th.jpg"

Infused with strong, intelligent humor, the film revolves around the journey of Richard and Jane who find in each other the strength to challenge the boundaries that have imprisoned them, body and mind. Richard, a frustrated artist, finds himself at odds with the local magistrate and is forced to perform 120 hours of community service - at the home of Jane. Relegated to a wheelchair by a neuro-muscular disorder, Jane proves a considerable challenge to the less than enthusiastic caretaker. Driven by a need to fix that which is broken in each of their lives, the two embark on an adventure for the soul that brings into unflinching perspective a timeless love and an unshakable friendship. 1 hr. 40 min.
