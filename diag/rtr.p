aS"1800026259\tThe Winners (1999)\tWhat becomes of the world-class violinists and pianists who win Brussels' Queen Elizabeth Competition - the musicians' Olympics? Four winners spanning the period 1955-1976 tell their stories. Most intriguing is Philipp Hirschhorn, once touted as the new Paganini. Now a broken man, he is seen watching scenes of himself some 20 years earlier, resplendent in white tie and tails, playing the violin brilliantly. His eyes come alive, but only for a moment. The film suggests that the reality of musical celebrity is darker and infinitely more complex than one might imagine. Questions of personality, musical technique, political intrigue, anti-Semitism (concerning the Russian Jews), bad timing, and bad luck are brought to bear in this fascinating exploration of what it takes to go from being a winner to becoming a star.\t1 hr. 25 min.\tNR\t\\N\tJanuary 20, 1999\t19990120\tFirst Run Features\tguide/01896901.jpg\tArt/Foreign|Documentary\tPaul Cohen\t1800026260\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\n"

One of their first stops is a bar where the women relax, dance, and flirt with some of the locals. But the situation turns ugly when one man (Timothy Carhart) follows Thelma to the parking lot and attempts to rape her, causing Louise to shoot and accidentally kill him. Convinced that the police will never believe their version of the incident, the women take off, now fugitives from the law. Emboldened by recent events, Thelma picks up studly young cowboy J.D. (Brad Pitt) in Oklahoma and enjoys a one-night stand that leads to even more trouble. Director Ridley Scott's infamous feminist road movie ranks among the best films of the 1990s. Along with BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN, the film is one of Scott's finest works, largely because of Callie Khourie's vivid, brilliantly idiosyncratic script, wonderful performances from the two leads, and Adrian's Biddle's crisp photography of the American Southwest.\t\\N\tR\t\\N\t\t19910101\t\\N\tallposters/22/1800026322p-th.jpg\t\\N\tRidley Scott\t1800015105\tEditor|Screenwriter|Cinematographer\tThom Noble|Callie Khouri|Adrian Biddle\t1800193636|1800242845|1800108027\tSusan Sarandon|Geena Davis|Harvey Keitel|Christopher McDonald|Brad Pitt|Michael Madsen|Timothy Carhart|Susen Sarandon\t1800019379|1800012507|1800014968|1800021801|1800018965|1800021340|1800056643|1800026323\t\\N\t\\N\t2\t15\tBest Original Screenplay (Academy 1991)|Best Screenplay (Golden Globe 1992)\tBest Actress (Academy 1991)|Best Director (Academy 1991)|Best Cinematography (Academy 1991)|Best Editing (Academy 1991)|Best Film (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Director (David Lean Award) (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Actress (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Original Screenplay (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Film (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|Best Actress (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|10 Best Films (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Actress (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Film (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Actress (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Supporting Actor (SOC 1991)\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t9.91345920653497\t10.3170731707317\t41\n"

S"1800039321 Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969) Paul Mazursky's directorial debut effectively and comically deals with many of the frailties of the sexually enlightened 1960s. Bob (Robert Culp) is a successful documentary filmmaker who takes his wife, Carol (Natalie Wood), to a remote California retreat for group therapy, intending on observing only in the hopes of making a new documentary. However, the hipster couple immediately become involved in the therapy, embracing the groovy ideals of swinging couples, tai chi, emoting, and primal screams. They arrive home full of new feelings and radical ideas about their marriage and successfully amuse their best friends, Ted (Elliott Gould) and Alice (Dyan Cannon), a much straighter version of themselves. However, after Bob and Carol admit, accept, and practically celebrate their extramarital affairs, Ted and Alice are so shocked by their liberal standpoint that Alice must seek psychiatric treatment. In therapy, however, Alice realizes her own illicit desires. After articulating them to her husband, the foursome head to Las Vegas in an attempt to become more than just friends in a far-out finale, famous for its menage \xe0 quatre theme. This stylish satire is a simultaneously poignant and amusing account of radical sexual experimentation, rampant with Nehru jackets, Pucci bikinis, love beads, and psychedelic parties. \\N R \\N  \\N \\N /video/images/muze/vhs/sm/66/173066.jpg"

Alan Arkin stars as Leonard Hoffman, an insurance salesman and father of triplets. When it becomes apparent that his dream of sending his three sons to Yale is financially impossible, opportunity presents itself in the form of Blanche (Beverly D\x92Angelo), sexy wife of Steve Rickey (Peter Falk), who convinces Leonard to trick her husband into signing an obscure life insurance plan that promises a huge payoff if he dies while falling from a train. After the mission is seemingly accomplished, Steve reappears, confusing matters, and thereby sending Leonard\x92s life into an official tailspin. Director John Cassavetes\x92s is credited as the director of BIG TROUBLE; he actually stepped in as a replacement. Although the film is therefore not a unique Cassavetes document, it manages to breeze along, guided by the performances of Falk (a Cassavetes standby) and Arkin, stars of 1979\x92s THE IN-LAWS. \\N R \\N  \\N \\N /video/images/muze/dvd/sm/48/209648.jpg'

The Muppets travel to "Area 51" and, after an encounter with a particularly surly MIB Agent (Terry "Hulk Hogan" Bollea), break in (with a little help from Bobo).  They then find that Gonzo was the only of his race to escape from the crash-landing, and that he suffered from amnesia as a result of not being in contact with others of his own kind.  Now that they are all together again, Gonzo regains his memory. He then realizes that, since he has returned, his race can return to their planet, via a odd-looking (you\'ll have to see it for yourself) spaceship.  Now, Gonzo has to face an awful decision: will he leave his friends to return to his own kind, or will he stay with the muppets and deny his race the opportunity to return home at last? 01987901.jpg G Family, Comedy Gonzo, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Rizzo, Jeffrey Tambor Timothy Hill July 14, 1999 Nationwide 83 http://www.muppetsfromspace.com Columbia Pictures Brian Henson, Martin Baker Jerry Juhl, Joseph Mazzarino 19879  Among Giants 2 An off-beat adventure set amongst England\'s working class, Pete Postlethwaite stars as Ray, a foreman whose rag-tag crew of handymen will take on any job, legal or not.
