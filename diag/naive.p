aS"1800026259\tThe Winners (1999)\tWhat becomes of the world-class violinists and pianists who win Brussels' Queen Elizabeth Competition - the musicians' Olympics? Four winners spanning the period 1955-1976 tell their stories. Most intriguing is Philipp Hirschhorn, once touted as the new Paganini. Now a broken man, he is seen watching scenes of himself some 20 years earlier, resplendent in white tie and tails, playing the violin brilliantly. His eyes come alive, but only for a moment. The film suggests that the reality of musical celebrity is darker and infinitely more complex than one might imagine. Questions of personality, musical technique, political intrigue, anti-Semitism (concerning the Russian Jews), bad timing, and bad luck are brought to bear in this fascinating exploration of what it takes to go from being a winner to becoming a star.\t1 hr. 25 min.\tNR\t\\N\tJanuary 20, 1999\t19990120\tFirst Run Features\tguide/01896901.jpg\tArt/Foreign|Documentary\tPaul Cohen\t1800026260\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\n"

One of their first stops is a bar where the women relax, dance, and flirt with some of the locals. But the situation turns ugly when one man (Timothy Carhart) follows Thelma to the parking lot and attempts to rape her, causing Louise to shoot and accidentally kill him. Convinced that the police will never believe their version of the incident, the women take off, now fugitives from the law. Emboldened by recent events, Thelma picks up studly young cowboy J.D. (Brad Pitt) in Oklahoma and enjoys a one-night stand that leads to even more trouble. Director Ridley Scott's infamous feminist road movie ranks among the best films of the 1990s. Along with BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN, the film is one of Scott's finest works, largely because of Callie Khourie's vivid, brilliantly idiosyncratic script, wonderful performances from the two leads, and Adrian's Biddle's crisp photography of the American Southwest.\t\\N\tR\t\\N\t\t19910101\t\\N\tallposters/22/1800026322p-th.jpg\t\\N\tRidley Scott\t1800015105\tEditor|Screenwriter|Cinematographer\tThom Noble|Callie Khouri|Adrian Biddle\t1800193636|1800242845|1800108027\tSusan Sarandon|Geena Davis|Harvey Keitel|Christopher McDonald|Brad Pitt|Michael Madsen|Timothy Carhart|Susen Sarandon\t1800019379|1800012507|1800014968|1800021801|1800018965|1800021340|1800056643|1800026323\t\\N\t\\N\t2\t15\tBest Original Screenplay (Academy 1991)|Best Screenplay (Golden Globe 1992)\tBest Actress (Academy 1991)|Best Director (Academy 1991)|Best Cinematography (Academy 1991)|Best Editing (Academy 1991)|Best Film (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Director (David Lean Award) (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Actress (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Original Screenplay (British Academy Awards 1991)|Best Film (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|Best Actress (Drama) (Golden Globe 1992)|10 Best Films (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Actress (National Board of Review of Motion Pict 1991)|Best Film (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Actress (New York Film Critics Circle 1991)|Best Supporting Actor (SOC 1991)\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t\\N\t9.91345920653497\t10.3170731707317\t41\n"

As word of his miracles gets out, con man Bill Hill (Christopher Walken) sees money in these divine occurrences and sends promoter pal Lynn Faulkner (Bridget Fonda) to infiltrate Juvenal's world and find out if he's authentic. In true farcical style, she falls for him in the process. What follows are many slightly zany attempts to capture Juvenal and his powers by a religious zealot and two sharklike reporters. Surprisingly slick and light, TOUCH (based on the novel by Elmore Leonard) is highlighted by a knockout supporting cast and is filled with cool dialogue and enhanced by hip production design.

He soon has more business than he can handle, and his burgeoning company attracts the attention of "Big" Barney Nolan, the criminal president of the Civil Betterment Bureau who wants to buy the company. Angered by the matchmaker\'s unwillingness to sell out, Nolan decides to have him investigated by Clem (Clarence H. Wilson), the district attorney. Allie Summers (Pert Kelton), the ex-wife of William\'s legal counsel and cabdriver Bramwell Van Dusen (Skeets Gallegher), threatens to reveal the couple\'s divorce to Clem unless William agrees to provide her with an introduction to Oklahoma millionaire bachelor Don Beldon (Grady Sutton). Knowing the oil man\'s preference for a woman who is "unsullied," William has decided to introduce him instead to Cynthia, but finds that Allie has already begun her pursuit of the unsuspecting magnate.

The House of MacPherson has been supplying Scottish tweeds for years--its weavers make the tweed in their homes on the Scottish islands, and the staff sells it in the company\x92s Edinburgh premises. When Old MacPherson (Ernest Thesiger) dies, his son, Young MacPherson (Robert Morley), takes over and brings in an efficiency expert. That\x92s bad enough, but worse, the expert is a woman and, even worse than that, she is an American woman. Horrors. The staff, led by Mr. Martin (Peter Sellers), is aghast. The expert Angela Barrows (Constance Cummings) begins to organize, to streamline, and to make plans to update the company\x92s manufacturing methods. Young MacPherson is entranced--seduced by the idea of becoming famous for "his" soon-to-be-implemented revolutionary manufacturing methods. However, the ever-deferential Mr. Martin discovers unexpected levels of cunning as he pits his wits against the brash American. THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES is crisply directed by Charles Crichton, with a witty script by Monja Danischewsky, based on a James Thurber story. And Peter Sellers gives a fine performance as the shy, inhibited Mr. Martin, who turns out to be an extraordinary schemer. \\N Unrated \\N  \\N \\N \\N'

S"1800018978 Get Real (1999) Simon Shore manages the transition from television and documentary to feature filmmaking with great assurance in his debut, the captivating, gay comedy Get Real, based on Patrick Wilde's stage success, What's Wrong with Anger? Shore recounts an appealing tale of a teenaged schoolboy coming to grips with his emerging sexuality. Sixteen-year-old Steven is just another teenager: He listens to the latest music, plays computer games, hangs out with friends. But Steven has a secret: He's in love with the school's top athlete, the devastatingly handsome John Dixon. Not surprisingly, Dixon is dating a model and is the object of every girl's attention. Steven certainly can't tell his parents, and none of his friends know he's gay; he can only confide in his best pal, the overweight, feisty Linda, who wants a romance of her own. As if this weren't complicated enough, Steven discovers that one of the girls at school has developed a crush on him. And then Dixon notices Steven'!  s attention. Shore and his cast of youngsters do a wonderful job of capturing the secret lives of his teenage characters. He penetrates the hearts and minds of people trying to understand their complex sexual yearnings, while compensating for the expectations of parents, friends, and society. Fresh, youthful, and invigorating, Get Real establishes its moving tone from the beginning and doesn't let go; it takes an incisive voyage into the world of a gay teenager trying to tell the world that there's nothing wrong with being in love. 1 hr. 50 min.

As the season and the film progresses, his team look certain to end a barren run of eighteen years without winning the Football League Championship. Paul meets Sarah, who has a propensity for severity, dourness and single-minded professionalism. Against their better judgment -- Paul thinks Sarah is too uptight, Sarah thinks Paul is a monomaniacal yob -- they embark on an occasionally stormy relationship. And Paul soon discovers that, unlike football, relationships aren\'t played out in seasons. Their roller coaster relationship becomes even more entertaining and enthralling than the nailbiting end to the League Championship, and Sarah comes to understand not only that football can be more than "just a game," but that it has the potential for the kind of heart-stopping dream-come-true moments rarely found in life. 1 hr. 37 min.
